Description:
My project is called Restaurant Match. 
It is a tinder style app where people match with restaurants in their area that they have not tried yet. 
The app only recommends places that the user has not matched with/ eaten at yet. 
Users will have the ability to save their favorite restaurants and view the favorite restaurants of any users they are friends with on the app.

Running the app:
To run the app, simply click on the TP V5 file.
Once the python file opens, run it
You will have the option to either create an account or login
Once you do that you will be directed to the search page where you look up
the catagory of food you are interested in, your search radius (6-25 miles),
and your current address. Once you click search the app will run and bring up a list
of restaurant profiles

Libraries:
This app uses the following libraries:
Decimal
String
Math
Requests
cmu-112-graphics
csv
os.path
